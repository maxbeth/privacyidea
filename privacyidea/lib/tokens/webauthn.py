Business logic for WebAuthn protocol.

This file contains a partial implementation of the server part of the WebAuthn
protocol. It currently uses a library written by Duo Security to do most of the
heavy lifting. The functions in this file that make use of this library will be
gradually rewritten to implement the necessary functionality themselves,
allowing us to remove the external dependency.

This file is tested in tests/test_lib_tokens_webauthn.py
